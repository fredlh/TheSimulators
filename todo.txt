OrgUnit:
--------
- Check whether all fields are implemented correctly
- Any use of OrganisationUnitGroups?


OrganisationUnitGroups:
-----------------------
- Need to be able to manage them?
- How to add and remove groups from an orgUnit?


OrganisationUnitLevels:
-----------------------
- Implement a manage OrganisationUnitLevels panel where a user can view info, add and delete orgUnitLevels


Search:
------
- Auto search on each new word, rather than a button?
- Combine the orgUnit and place search into same place, with a switch under advanced settings or so?
- Able to place a marker and say "get all orgUnits (filter too?) within x distance"
- Implement the local filters here too? (filter on name and orgUnitGroup)


Delete:
-------
- Check further how to delete orgUnits with groups?
- Only able to delete orgUnits with no groups?
- Remove the functionality?


Filter:
-------
- Add filter option on OrganisationUnitGroups with a multiple select or such


General:
--------
- Commenting
- Decide on final design (placement of things and color)
- Go through all HTML & CSS, fix naming conventions and as much as hard coded of pixels as possible


API notes/suggestions:
----------------------
- Why the need of two-way binding of orgUnitGroups?
    - Isn't it enoug that each orgUnit knows their group, and the OrganisationUnitGroups is just a lookup object?
- Why doesn't the API require a OrganisationUnitLevel for each level an orgUnit can have?
- Why do delete error compalin about "DataObject" and not specify which binding it fails on?
