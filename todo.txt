OrgUnit:
--------
- Check whether all fields are implemented correctly
- Any use of OrganisationUnitGroups?


OrgUnitService:
---------------
- Create updateOrgUnit()
- Split parts to mapService and communicationSerice(or something)
- Use Globals.getMaxLevel() to check whether maxLevel is reached instead of hard coding it


Search:
------
- Auto search on each new word, rather than a button?
- Combine the orgUnit and place search into same place, with a switch under advanced settings or so?
- Able to place a marker and say "get all orgUnits (filter too?) within x distance"


Side bar:
---------
- Implement a canGetChildren() function which checks whether the getChildren() button should be clickable


Edit org unit:
--------------
- Add the same logic for drawButtons, clearButtons and featureType as in addOrgUnit


Globals:
--------
- Implement a getMaxLevel() function which returns the max level an org unit can have


General:
--------
- Cleanup of imports
- When adding, deleting and updating orgUnit, update map and list or do nothing?



Thoughts (Rune):
- "BUG": Can select parent in list and get children repeatedly (adding new pushes to the org unit stack)
