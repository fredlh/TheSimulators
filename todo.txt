OrganisationUnitGroups:
-----------------------
- Following works:
    - Adding new orgUnitGroup
    - Delete self-added orgUnitGroup
    - Modify existing orgUnitGroup
- Following doesn't work:
    - Delete existing orgUnitGroup
    - Modify self-added orgUnitGroup

- What to do about the stuff that doesn't work?
    - Fix it or just remove add and deletion of orgUnitGroups

- Can get the image from the API, but how to display it?

- How to handle multiple open orgUnitGroups?
    - Only have a single selectedOrgUnitGroup and reset it every time the user opens a new one?
    - Create a selectedOrgUnitGroup for each group, so that the "state" for each group is saved?

- How to habdle update? (Refresh, delete, add, ...)
    - Auto update?
        - If yes, okay if the group collapses?
    - Refresh button on top of the page which the user have to click manually?


Delete:
-------
- Check further how to delete orgUnits with groups?
- Only able to delete orgUnits with no groups?
- Remove the functionality?


Map:
---
- Different shapes of select and de-selected facility marker
    - Makes it zoom a bit out and in when toggling
- Crashing when trying to display an orgUnit with undefined coordinates
    - Happens when adding an orgUnit with no coordinates and trying to draw it


General:
--------
- Print an error message at the bottom/top of the screen or something (such as error on delete orgUnit)
- Commenting
- Decide on final design (placement of things and color)
- Go through all HTML & CSS, fix naming conventions and as much as hard coded of pixels as possible


API notes/suggestions:
----------------------
- Why the need of two-way binding of orgUnitGroups?
    - Isn't it enoug that each orgUnit knows their group, and the OrganisationUnitGroups is just a lookup object?
    - If not, why not let orgUnit be the boss? Update it, and the groups are auto updated
- Why doesn't the API require a OrganisationUnitLevel for each level an orgUnit can have?
- Why do delete error compalin about "DataObject" and not specify which binding it fails on?
- Why can parent be undefined? Why not require and just have empty string if no parent (level 1)?
