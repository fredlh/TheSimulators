OrganisationUnitGroups:
-----------------------
- Need to be able to manage them?
- How to add and remove groups from an orgUnit?


Search:
------
- Auto search on each new word, rather than a button?
- Combine the orgUnit and place search into same place, with a switch under advanced settings or so?
- Able to place a marker and say "get all orgUnits (filter too?) within x distance"
- Implement the local filters here too? (filter on name and orgUnitGroup)


Delete:
-------
- Check further how to delete orgUnits with groups?
- Only able to delete orgUnits with no groups?
- Remove the functionality?


Filter:
-------
- Add filter option on OrganisationUnitGroups with a multiple select or such
- Move the filter when the side bar is resized
- New placement?


Side bar:
---------
- Display the parent name as well as the ID?
    - If yes, how to? A button to retrieve the info or retrive when clicked on in the side bar?


General:
--------
- Commenting
- Decide on final design (placement of things and color)
- Go through all HTML & CSS, fix naming conventions and as much as hard coded of pixels as possible


API notes/suggestions:
----------------------
- Why the need of two-way binding of orgUnitGroups?
    - Isn't it enoug that each orgUnit knows their group, and the OrganisationUnitGroups is just a lookup object?
- Why doesn't the API require a OrganisationUnitLevel for each level an orgUnit can have?
- Why do delete error compalin about "DataObject" and not specify which binding it fails on?
- Why can parent be undefined? Why not require and just have empty string if no parent (level 1)?
