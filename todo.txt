OrganisationUnitGroups:
-----------------------
- Can get the image from the API, but how to display it?


Map:
---
- Change the facility icon such that selected/not selected is more obvious?
- Crashing when trying to flyTo if allCoords.size === 0
    - Fredrik have added quick-fix, just change if it can be done better


General:
--------
- Bugchecking
- Go throug and check if colors and placements are good
- Updating wiki
- Write a README
    - Mention all the api struggles so far
    - Mention angular-starter, multiple select projects and accordion component
- Make all functions in sideBar and such which isnt meant to be called from outside to private?
- Any way to get an error message for deleting an orgUnitLevel?
    - If yes, display that one rather than a generic one which is currently used


API notes/suggestions:
----------------------
- Why the need of two-way binding of orgUnitGroups?
    - Isn't it enoug that each orgUnit knows their group, and the OrganisationUnitGroups is just a lookup object?
    - If not, why not let orgUnit be the boss? Update it, and the groups are auto updated
- Why doesn't the API require a OrganisationUnitLevel for each level an orgUnit can have?
- Why do delete error compalin about "DataObject" and not specify which binding it fails on?
- Why can parent be undefined? Why not require and just have empty string if no parent (level 1)?
- Documentation of which fields are requiered when saving an orgUnit
