Search:
------
- Auto search on each new word, rather than a button?
--- Implement advanced search
--- How to return all results and let the user be able to select one?


Map:
----
- Draw function which accepts an OrgUnit object --> draws the orgUnit on the map
- A drawn OrgUnit should be clickable
    - View the info in some sort of textarea or label?
    - Edit button
        - Open a form, default values are the existing ones, able to edit
        - Save button which updates the orgUnit on the server
    - Delete button
        - Deletes the orgUnit from the server
        - Remove the orgUnit from the map
- Able to create new orgUnit
    - By placing a marker
    - By writing in the longitude and latitude (default current ones)
        - View chose ones in real-time on map?

Side bar:
---------
--- Make it an expandable list?
--- Make it possible to hide and show?
- List all info of a selected orgUnit
    - Including info of its children?


General:
--------
- Cleanup of imports
    - Remove unneeded ones
    - Fix the layout (order of imports + pretty-looking ones)



Thoughts (Rune):
- Hide all other elements on the map when editing/creating new polygons
    - Could potentially draw the old data (the data to edit) twice, once to edit
      and another to show the status pre-edit
    - Fixes issues with elements being clickable, could also do an invisible layer over everything
- What happens when editing an id without coordinates, with marker coordinates etc?
- Need to guarantee either save or revert on add/edit polygons
- Filter searches based on level, string starting with, ending with, contains...
- "edit mode" for polygons and possibly markers
