OrgUnit:
--------
- Check whether all fields are implemented correctly
- Any use of OrganisationUnitGroups?


OrgUnitService:
---------------
- Split parts to mapService and communicationSerice(or something)
- Cleanup: remove unneeded functions, re-order and such


Search:
------
- Auto search on each new word, rather than a button?
- Combine the orgUnit and place search into same place, with a switch under advanced settings or so?
- Able to place a marker and say "get all orgUnits (filter too?) within x distance"


General:
--------
- Cleanup of imports
